## Branches

`main` - Live version, which is auto deployed

`feature/<jira-id>/<jira-name>` - Feature branches,
these branch off of the `main` branch

### Conventions
Please ensure that **EVERY** time you start work, in **ANY** branch, you do the following:
> - Update that branch from the `main` branch first.
> - Update your local dependencies.
>
> This will ensure that you are always working with the most recent version of the code.

Likewise, whenever you are about to make a pull request:
> - Update the branch from the `main` branch.
> 
> If everyone follows this, merge conflicts will be almost entirely eliminated.

Finally, whenever you update dependencies:
> - Push this information into the main branch as soon as possible.
> 
> This final point will ensure that everyone is working with the most recent set of dependencies, 
which will furher help reduce conflicts.
