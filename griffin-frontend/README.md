This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You must have Yarn installed to run this application: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

Once ``yarn`` is installed **NOT** ``npm``:

Navigate to the ``griffin-frontend`` folder.  
```
cd griffin-frontend
```

Then, update your dependencies.  
```
yarn
```

Then, run the development server.  
```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
